## There exist a variety of tools

Tool that can help you to
- be more productive (automation)
- make your work accessible by others (packaging)
- making sure you are doing it right (testing)
- keep a history of what you have done (git)


---

## You don't know about all of these tools 

* But some of your colleagues might now
* Many of us have stumbled upon problems that we found a solution to
* It would be good if we could help each other.


---

## Example of tools

You are trying to track down a bug in your python code and you put print statements all around your code. Once you found the bug, you remove the print statements again.

* Does there exist a better way?
* You can use a debugger!
  ```python
  breakpoint()
  ```
* You can implement a logger with the possibility to turn on debug mode
  ```python
  logger.debug("Detailed information")
  ```


---

## How do you know that code is working as expected?

* You have tests (how to test your code?)
* How do you know that your code keeps working when you make changes?
* You run the tests after changing the code
* And if you collaborate with someone?
* You have a continuos integration (CI) system (such as Github action)
